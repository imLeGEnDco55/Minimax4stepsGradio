"""The halves of a **split** MiniMax-H3 deployment, for both of its checkpoint partitions.

MiniMax-H3 is 195.9 GiB in bfloat16 and a ZeroGPU Space is evicted at 150 GB of storage, so `MiniMaxH3Blocks` is cut
at its `text_encoder` step: the 62.14 GiB Qwen3-VL runs in the conditioner Space, everything else in a generator
Space, and `prompt_embeds` + `text_token_tags` is the whole wire format between them.

`resize` / `setup` run on **both** sides: they own no pretrained component, and each half needs the canvas and the
prepared keyframes or normalized references. Both conditioner halves also return the resolved `height` / `width` /
`num_frames`, which the generating half pins rather than re-deriving.

Two things the blocks leave to the caller: a keyframe reaches them EXIF-transposed and in RGB, and the `t2va` / `fl2va`
frame count is aligned to `17 * n + 5` before the call, since that arithmetic lives on the denoising side of the cut.
